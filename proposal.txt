Title: Gaussian Process Emulation of Agricultural Computer Models

Sophisticated computer models are enabling model-enhanced prediction of crop yield, crop biomass, nitrate leaching, soil loss, etc. Statistical emulators of these computer models aid in optimization, calibration, run design, and prediction. We are working on developing emulators for the Agricultural Systems Modelling and Simulaton (APSIM) [https://www.apsim.info/] and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) [ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/west-lafayette-in/national-soil-erosion-research/docs/wepp/research/] computer models. WEPP is currently being used to estimate daily soil loss in Iowa and surrounding areas [https://www.dailyerosion.org/]. Baker Center personnel Niemi, working with Andy VanLoocke (ISU- Agronomy) [https://www.agron.iastate.edu/people/andy-vanloocke] and Emily Heaton (University of Illinois - Crop Sciences), are constructing Gaussian Process emulators (GPs) for these computers models. While GPs have long been used with scalar-valued input, we are extending the methodology to accommodate functional input, e.g. precipitation and soil profiles.
